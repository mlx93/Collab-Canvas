# PR #7: Multiplayer Cursors, Selection State & Live Position Streaming

## 🎯 Goal
Implement **true real-time multiplayer** with:
1. **Multiplayer cursors** (colored, labeled with color names)
2. **Selection state** (RTDB ephemeral - doesn't persist)
3. **Live position streaming** (60 FPS smooth shape movement during drag/resize)

## 🚀 What's New (Enhanced from Original PR #7)

### Original PR #7:
- Multiplayer cursors
- Selection state (RTDB)

### **ENHANCED PR #7 (Your Request):**
- ✅ Multiplayer cursors
- ✅ Selection state (RTDB)
- ✨ **NEW: Live position/resize streaming**
- ✨ **NEW: Other users see shapes moving smoothly in real-time (60 FPS)**
- ✨ **NEW: Not just final results, but intermediate positions**

## 📋 Architecture

### RTDB Paths
```
/cursors/{canvasId}/{userId}
  - x, y, userId, colorName, cursorColor, lastUpdate

/selections/{canvasId}/{userId}
  - selectedShapeId, selectedAt

/livePositions/{canvasId}/{shapeId}  <-- NEW!
  - userId, x, y, width, height, lastUpdate
```

### Key Features

#### 1. **Cursor Tracking (60 FPS)**
- Mouse position tracked and sent to RTDB (throttled to 16ms)
- Each user has a deterministic color based on email hash
- Cursor label shows color NAME (e.g., "Blue", "Red") - not username

#### 2. **Selection State (Ephemeral)**
- Tracks which shape each user has selected
- Stored in RTDB only (doesn't persist across refreshes)
- Auto-clears on disconnect

#### 3. **Live Position Streaming (60 FPS) - NEW!**
- During drag: Send intermediate x, y positions to RTDB (throttled to 16ms)
- During resize: Send intermediate x, y, width, height to RTDB (throttled to 16ms)
- Other users subscribe and render these live positions
- **Critical: Only render live position if `userId !== currentUser.userId`**
  - This ensures own optimistic updates are not overridden
- Auto-clears on dragEnd/resizeEnd

## 🔧 Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed:
- [x] Task 7.1: Create cursor types
- [x] Task 7.2: Create throttle utility (16ms / 60 FPS)
- [x] Task 7.3: Verify RTDB security rules (added `livePositions`)
- [x] Task 7.4: Build cursor service (RTDB)
- [x] Task 7.5: Build selection service (RTDB)
- [x] Task 7.5b: **NEW** Build livePositions service (RTDB)

### 🚧 In Progress:
- [ ] Task 7.6: Create useCursors hook
- [ ] Task 7.7: Build CursorOverlay component
- [ ] Task 7.8: Integrate cursor tracking in Canvas
- [ ] Task 7.8b: **NEW** Integrate live position streaming in Rectangle
- [ ] Task 7.9: Add cursor overlay to Canvas
- [ ] Task 7.10: Integrate selection state with RTDB
- [ ] Task 7.11: Style cursor labels with color names

### 🧪 Testing (Pending):
- [ ] Unit tests: throttle utility
- [ ] Unit tests: cursor service
- [ ] Unit tests: selection service
- [ ] Unit tests: **NEW** livePositions service
- [ ] Integration tests: cursor sync + live position streaming
- [ ] Manual testing: 2+ users with cursors + live movement

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before PR #7:
1. User A drags shape → **Badge: "John is moving"** ✅
2. User A dragging... → **User B does NOT see it moving** ❌
3. User A releases → **Shape snaps to final position for User B** ✅

### After PR #7:
1. User A drags shape → **Badge: "John is moving"** ✅
2. User A dragging... → **User B sees it moving smoothly (60 FPS)** ✨
3. User A releases → **Already at final position (smooth sync)** ✅

## 📊 Performance

- **Cursor updates**: Throttled to 16ms (60 FPS)
- **Live position updates**: Throttled to 16ms (60 FPS)
- **RTDB latency**: <50ms typical
- **Total perceived latency**: ~66ms (16ms throttle + 50ms RTDB)
- **Result**: Smooth, fluid multiplayer experience

## 🔐 Security

All new RTDB paths require authentication:
- `cursors`: Read (any auth user), Write (own userId only)
- `selections`: Read (any auth user), Write (own userId only)
- `livePositions`: Read (any auth user), Write (any auth user)

## 🧩 Integration Points

### Rectangle.tsx (Task 7.8b)
- `onDragMove`: Call `setLivePosition()` (throttled)
- `onDragEnd`: Call `clearLivePosition()`
- Resize drag: Call `setLivePosition()` (throttled)
- Resize end: Call `clearLivePosition()`
- Subscribe to `livePositions` for this shape
- **If livePosition exists AND userId !== currentUser:**
  - Render shape at live position (override local state)
- **Else:**
  - Render shape at local state (optimistic update)

### Canvas.tsx (Task 7.8)
- Track mouse position over canvas
- Send to RTDB via `updateCursorPosition()` (throttled to 16ms)
- Render `CursorOverlay` component

### CanvasContext.tsx (Task 7.10)
- On shape select: `setSelection(userId, shapeId)`
- On deselect: `clearSelection(userId)`
- Subscribe to `subscribeToSelections()` for other users

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Implement useCursors hook
2. Build CursorOverlay component
3. Integrate cursor tracking in Canvas
4. **Integrate live position streaming in Rectangle** (KEY!)
5. Write all tests (unit + integration)
6. Manual testing with 2+ users
7. Git commit, merge, deploy to prod

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [x] Services created and structured
- [ ] Cursors render at 60 FPS
- [ ] Cursor labels show color names (not emails)
- [ ] **Shapes move smoothly in real-time during drag/resize**
- [ ] **Live positions don't override own optimistic updates**
- [ ] Selection state syncs across users
- [ ] All data auto-clears on disconnect
- [ ] 100% test coverage
- [ ] Manual testing confirms smooth multiplayer experience
