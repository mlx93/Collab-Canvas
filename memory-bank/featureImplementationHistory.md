## Major Feature Implementations

### Multi-Selection System (December 2024)

**Implementation**: Array-based selection state with multiple interaction methods

**Features Delivered**:
- Shift-click to add/remove shapes from selection
- Multi-drag operations with all shape types
- Relative position maintenance during multi-drag
- Live position broadcasting for all selected shapes
- Selection state synchronization across users

**Critical Fixes**:

1. **Multi-Drag Movement Bug** (October 2025)
   - **Issue**: Rectangle multi-drag didn't work as leader; only Rectangle moved, followers didn't follow
   - **Root Causes**: 
     - Follower shapes remained draggable during multi-drag (Konva conflict)
     - Stale closures in multi-drag functions (missing useCallback)
     - Async state updates vs synchronous events (refs needed instead of state)
   - **Solution**: Fixed draggable properties, added useCallback wrappers, changed to refs
   - **Result**: All shapes work uniformly as leaders and followers

2. **Multi-Select Live Broadcasting Bug** (December 2024)
   - **Issue**: Follower shapes didn't broadcast live positions to other users
   - **Root Cause**: Follower shapes didn't have activeEdit set, so other users didn't subscribe
   - **Solution**: Set activeEdit for ALL selected shapes during multi-drag
   - **Result**: Other users see all selected shapes moving smoothly in real-time

3. **Multi-Drag Active Edit Cleanup Bug** (January 2025)
   - **Issue**: "Bob is moving" indicators persisted after multi-drag completion
   - **Root Cause**: Race condition between shape handleDragEnd and endMultiDrag
   - **Solution**: Only shape components clear activeEdit for single-shape drags; endMultiDrag handles multi-drag cleanup
   - **Result**: Clean active edit state after multi-drag operations

**Files Modified**: Canvas.tsx, Rectangle.tsx, Circle.tsx, Triangle.tsx, Line.tsx, Text.tsx

**Critical Fixes**:

1. **Selection Logic Bug** (January 2025)
   - **Issue**: Clicking to deselect was adding shapes to selection
   - **Root Cause**: handleSelect using selectShape instead of deselectShape
   - **Solution**: Fixed handleSelect to use deselectShape(id) for deselection
   - **Result**: Proper select/deselect behavior

2. **Z-Index Propagation Bug** (January 2025)
   - **Issue**: Moving rows didn't update canvas layering
   - **Root Cause**: Firestore service auto-overriding z-index with maxZIndex + 1
   - **Solution**: Only auto-update z-index when z-index is NOT explicitly provided
   - **Result**: Manual z-index updates propagate correctly

3. **Optimistic Z-Index Updates** (October 2025)
   - **Implementation**: Immediate local state updates + RTDB broadcasting
   - **Created**: batchSetZIndex function for atomic multi-shape updates
   - **Result**: Instant visual feedback for z-index changes

4. **Lock Prevents Reordering** (October 2025)
   - **Issue**: Locked shapes could still be reordered
   - **Solution**: Added disabled: shape.locked to useSortable hook
   - **Result**: Locked shapes cannot be reordered, with visual feedback (60% opacity)

5. **Shape Naming** (October 2025)
   - **Issue**: Custom names weren't saving to Firestore
   - **Solution**: Fixed subscribeToShapes to load name field from Firestore
   - **Result**: Names persist across sessions and display correctly

6. **Double-Click Selection** (October 2025)
   - **Change**: Changed from single-click to double-click for better UX
   - **Benefit**: Prevents accidental selection during drag operations
   - **Multi-Selection**: Shift+double-click for multi-selection with proper toggle logic

**Files Created**: `LayersPanel.tsx`  
**Files Modified**: Canvas.tsx, CanvasContext.tsx, canvas.service.ts, PropertiesPanel.tsx

**Result**: Fully functional layers panel with professional UX and bidirectional sync

## Critical Performance Optimizations

### Editing Indicator Synchronization (January 2025)

**Problem**: Editing indicators lagged 8ms+ behind editing user's actual movement

**Root Cause**: Live position updates throttled to 8ms (120 FPS), but editing user's shape moved immediately

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Reduced Throttling**: Changed from 8ms (120 FPS) to 4ms (250 FPS)
2. **Immediate Drag Position Tracking**: Added immediateDragPosition state to all shape components
3. **Separated Position Logic**: Created shapePos (for rendering) and indicatorPos (for indicators)
4. **Z-Index Layer Management**: All indicators rendered in dedicated layer with zIndex={10000}
5. **Perfect Synchronization**: Editing indicators now move in perfect sync with shapes (0ms lag for local user, 4ms for others)

**Technical Changes**:
- Updated all shape components (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Line, Text)
- Enhanced activeEdits.service.ts and livePositions.service.ts with fire-and-forget operations
- Created indicatorPositioning.ts utility for consistent positioning
- Upgraded throttling from 60 FPS (16ms) to 250 FPS (4ms)

**Files Modified**: 12 files across services, components, and utilities

**Result**: Near-perfect synchronization (4ms lag virtually imperceptible) while maintaining efficient network usage

---

### Toast Position Consistency (January 2025)

**Problem**: "Bob is selected" and "Bob is moving" toasts appeared in different locations

**Solution**: Shared positioning utilities

**Implementation**:
- Created calculateIndicatorPosition and calculateTextWidth functions
- Both EditingIndicator and SelectionIndicator use same positioning logic
- Aligned circle indicators with other shapes
- Pixel-perfect alignment with no visual jumping

**Files Created**: `indicatorPositioning.ts`  
**Files Modified**: EditingIndicator.tsx, SelectionIndicator.tsx

**Result**: Consistent toast positioning across all indicator states

---

### Shape Positioning Optimization (October 2025)

**Problem**: New shapes created too far right and too low in viewport

**Root Cause**: Shapes positioned at horizontal center (availableWidth / 2) and vertical center (height / 2)

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Horizontal**: Changed from center to middle-left (availableWidth / 4)
- **Vertical**: Changed from center to slightly higher (height / 2.5)
- **Consistency**: Applied to all shape types (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Line, Text)
- **Properties Panel Awareness**: All positioning accounts for 288px properties panel width

**Files Modified**: CanvasContext.tsx (5 shape creation functions), LeftToolbar.tsx

**Result**: New shapes appear in more accessible location (middle-left of viewport)

---

### Z-Index "Shape Not Found" Error Fix (October 2025)

**Problem**: Users experiencing "Shape not found" errors on newly pasted/duplicated shapes

**Root Cause**: pasteShapes and duplicateShapes using temp IDs that didn't match Firestore IDs

**Solution**: Applied ID pre-generation pattern to paste/duplicate operations

**Implementation**:
- Changed pasteShapes to use canvasService.generateShapeId() upfront
- Changed duplicateShapes to use pre-generated Firestore IDs
- Updated both functions to use createRectangleWithId(id, shapeData)

**Files Modified**: CanvasContext.tsx (pasteShapes and duplicateShapes functions)

**Result**: Z-index operations work immediately on pasted/duplicated shapes with no errors

---

## Architecture Patterns Reference

### Optimistic Updates Pattern
1. User action â†’ Local state updates immediately
2. Async Firestore sync (~100ms)
3. Other users receive updates via real-time listeners
4. Conflict resolution via "last write wins"

### Live Position Streaming Pattern
1. User drags shape â†’ Set activeEdit for shape
2. Other users subscribe to live positions (activeEdit triggers subscription)
3. Throttled position updates (4ms) to RTDB
4. Other users render live position updates
5. Drag ends â†’ Clear activeEdit and live position

### Multi-Drag Pattern
1. User shift-clicks multiple shapes
2. User drags one shape (leader)
3. Calculate offsets for all selected shapes
4. Set activeEdit for ALL selected shapes
5. Broadcast live positions for all shapes (followers + leader)
6. Update positions in sync maintaining relative offsets
7. Drag ends â†’ Clear activeEdits for all shapes

### Clipboard Pattern
1. Copy: Deep clone selected shapes, remove IDs
2. Store in session memory (doesn't survive refresh)
3. Paste: Generate new UUIDs for shapes
4. Calculate positions relative to cursor
5. Maintain relative positioning for multi-shape selections
6. Create shapes in Firestore with new IDs
7. Broadcast selection for pasted shapes
