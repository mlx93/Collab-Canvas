# MVP Finalization Plan

## âœ… Current Status
**Code Complete!** App is working perfectly and deployed to production.
**Decision:** No more feature additions. Lock the MVP and prepare for submission.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Final Tasks (3-4 hours total)

### Phase 1: Load & Stress Testing (1-2 hours)

#### 1.1 Load Test Script - Create 500+ Rectangles
**File:** `src/utils/loadTestScript.ts` or run in browser console
**Test:**
- Generate 500 rectangles with random positions/colors/sizes
- Measure FPS during:
  - Pan operations
  - Zoom operations
  - Dragging a shape
  - Creating new shapes
- Document results

#### 1.2 Stress Test - Multi-User Scenarios
**Manual Testing:**
- [ ] 2 users editing same shape simultaneously (last write wins)
- [ ] 2 users editing different shapes simultaneously
- [ ] Rapid shape creation (10+ shapes in 10 seconds)
- [ ] User refresh mid-edit (state persistence)
- [ ] Network disconnect/reconnect
- [ ] 5+ concurrent users (if possible)

#### 1.3 Performance Measurements
- [ ] Measure sync latency (cursor vs shape updates)
- [ ] Measure FPS with 0, 50, 100, 200, 500 shapes
- [ ] Document results in spreadsheet/table

---

### Phase 2: README Documentation (30-45 mins)

#### 2.1 Update README.md
**Sections to add/update:**
- [ ] Deployment URL (https://collab-canvas-mlx93.web.app)
- [ ] Feature list (what works)
- [ ] Architecture overview (Firestore + RTDB + Firebase Auth)
- [ ] Tech stack (React, TypeScript, Konva, Tailwind, Firebase)
- [ ] Local development setup
- [ ] Firebase setup instructions
- [ ] Known limitations
- [ ] Performance characteristics

**Template structure:**
```markdown
# CollabCanvas

**Live Demo:** https://collab-canvas-mlx93.web.app

## Features
- Real-time collaborative canvas
- Rectangles with color, resize, move, delete
- Pan/zoom viewport
- Multiplayer cursors with user names
- Presence awareness
- Live editing indicators
- Optimistic updates
- Z-index management
- State persistence

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Konva.js, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, RTDB, Hosting)
- Real-time: Firebase Realtime Database (cursors, live positions, presence)
- Persistence: Cloud Firestore (shapes, user profiles)

## Architecture
[Brief description of hybrid Firebase architecture]

## Performance
- 60 FPS maintained during interactions
- <100ms sync for shape changes
- <50ms sync for cursor positions
- Supports 500+ shapes
- Supports 5+ concurrent users

## Setup
[Local development instructions]

## Deployment
[Firebase deployment commands]
```

### Phase 3: Code Cleanup (30-60 mins)

#### 3.1 Identify Unused Files
**Scan for:**
- [ ] Unused documentation files (MD files in root)
- [ ] Unused test files
- [ ] Unused utility files
- [ ] Temporary debug files
- [ ] Old architecture docs

**Keep:**
- PRD.md
- tasks.md
- README.md
- MVP_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
- All source code files
- All test files that are actually used

**Remove:**
- Old/outdated documentation
- Temporary plan files (PR*_PLAN.md, etc.)
- Debug documentation
- Duplicate architecture docs

#### 3.2 Remove Unused Code
**Check for:**
- [ ] Unused imports
- [ ] Commented-out code
- [ ] Unused utility functions
- [ ] Unused components
- [ ] Console.log statements (optional - can keep for debugging)

#### 3.3 Organize Documentation
**Move to `/docs` folder:**
- Architecture documentation
- Testing reports
- PR summaries
- Implementation notes

**Keep in root:**
- README.md
- PRD.md
- tasks.md

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics Verification

After testing, verify all MVP requirements:

### Hard Gate Requirements (Must Have):
- [x] Basic canvas with pan/zoom
- [x] At least one shape type (rectangle)
- [x] Ability to create and move objects
- [x] Real-time sync between 2+ users
- [x] Multiplayer cursors with name labels âœ… (FIXED!)
- [x] Presence awareness (who's online)
- [x] User authentication
- [x] Deployed and publicly accessible

### Performance Targets:
- [ ] 60 FPS during interactions (TEST)
- [ ] <100ms sync for shapes (TEST)
- [ ] <50ms sync for cursors (TEST)
- [ ] 500+ shapes supported (TEST)
- [ ] 5+ concurrent users (TEST)
