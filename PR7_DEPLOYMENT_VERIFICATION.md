## What Was Deployed

### 1. Firebase Hosting âœ…
- **URL**: https://collab-canvas-mlx93.web.app
- **Build**: Latest with PR #7 features
- **Files**: 14 files uploaded
- **Status**: Active

### 2. Realtime Database (RTDB) Rules âœ…
- **Database**: `collab-canvas-mlx93-default-rtdb`
- **Rules Status**: Released successfully
- **Canvas ID**: `default-canvas`

### 3. RTDB Security Rules Deployed:

#### `/cursors/default-canvas`
```json
{
  ".read": "auth != null",
  "$userId": {
    ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
  }
}
```
- **Purpose**: Real-time cursor positions (120 FPS)
- **Read**: All authenticated users can see all cursors
- **Write**: Users can only update their own cursor
- **Auto-cleanup**: onDisconnect hook removes cursor

#### `/livePositions/default-canvas`
```json
{
  ".read": "auth != null",
  "$shapeId": {
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```
- **Purpose**: Live position streaming during drag/resize (60 FPS)
- **Read**: All authenticated users can see all live positions
- **Write**: Any authenticated user can write (for any shape they edit)
- **Auto-cleanup**: onDisconnect hook clears on disconnect

#### `/selections/default-canvas`
```json
{
  ".read": "auth != null",
  "$userId": {
    ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
  }
}
```
- **Purpose**: Ephemeral selection state
- **Read**: All users see who has what selected
- **Write**: Users can only update their own selection
- **Auto-cleanup**: onDisconnect hook clears on disconnect

#### `/activeEdits/default-canvas`
```json
{
  ".read": "auth != null",
  "$shapeId": {
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```
- **Purpose**: "User is editing" indicators
- **Read**: All users see active edit states
- **Write**: Any user can write (when editing)
- **Auto-cleanup**: onDisconnect hook clears on disconnect

#### `/presence/default-canvas`
```json
{
  ".read": "auth != null",
  "$userId": {
    ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
  }
}
```
- **Purpose**: Online user presence (for future PR #8)
- **Read**: All users see who's online
- **Write**: Users can only update their own presence
- **Auto-cleanup**: onDisconnect hook sets offline

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Firebase Console
- Navigate to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collab-canvas-mlx93/database
- Verify RTDB is enabled and active
- Check that `collab-canvas-mlx93-default-rtdb` database exists

### 2. Check RTDB Rules in Console
- Go to: Database > Rules tab
- Verify rules match the deployed `database.rules.json`
- Check that rules were updated to latest version

### 3. Test in Production
- Open: https://collab-canvas-mlx93.web.app
- Log in with account
- Open browser console
- Look for console logs:
  ```
  [useCursors] User changed: <email>
  [useCursors] Creating throttled update for user: <email>
  [useCursors] Subscribing to cursors for user: <email>
  [cursor.service] Setting up subscription to: cursors/default-canvas
  ```

### 4. Verify RTDB Data Structure
In Firebase Console > Realtime Database > Data tab, you should see:
```
collab-canvas-mlx93-default-rtdb
  â”œâ”€â”€ cursors
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default-canvas
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ <userId>: { x, y, userId, colorName, cursorColor, lastUpdate }
  â”œâ”€â”€ livePositions
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default-canvas
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ <shapeId>: { userId, x, y, width, height, lastUpdate }
  â”œâ”€â”€ selections
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default-canvas
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ <userId>: { userId, selectedShapeId, selectedAt }
  â”œâ”€â”€ activeEdits
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default-canvas
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ <shapeId>: { userId, email, firstName, action, timestamp, cursorColor }
  â””â”€â”€ presence
      â””â”€â”€ default-canvas
          â””â”€â”€ <userId>: { online, email, joinedAt, lastSeen }
```

## Expected Behavior in Production

### When First User Logs In:
1. âœ… User cursor added to `/cursors/default-canvas/<userId>`
2. âœ… Console shows: `[cursor.service] Setting up subscription to: cursors/default-canvas`
3. âœ… NO colored cursor overlay for self (only native browser cursor)

### When Second User Logs In:
1. âœ… Both users see each other's cursors
2. âœ… Cursor labels show color names (e.g., "Blue", "Red"), not emails
3. âœ… Cursors track smoothly (120 FPS)

### When User A Drags Shape:
1. âœ… Live position written to `/livePositions/default-canvas/<shapeId>`
2. âœ… User B sees shape move in real-time (60 FPS)
3. âœ… Active edit indicator: "FirstName is moving"
4. âœ… User A's cursor appears at shape center

### When User A Releases Shape:
1. âœ… Live position cleared from RTDB
2. âœ… NO FLICKER in User B's view (1-second grace period)
3. âœ… Shape persists to Firestore
4. âœ… Active edit indicator disappears

### When User Disconnects:
1. âœ… Cursor auto-removed from `/cursors/default-canvas/<userId>`
2. âœ… Live positions auto-cleared
3. âœ… Selection auto-cleared
4. âœ… Active edits auto-cleared

## Troubleshooting

### If cursors don't appear:
1. Check browser console for permission errors
2. Verify user is authenticated (logged in)
3. Check RTDB rules are deployed: `firebase deploy --only database`
4. Verify RTDB URL in `src/services/firebase.ts`

### If live positions don't stream:
1. Check console for RTDB permission errors
2. Verify `/livePositions/default-canvas` path exists
3. Check throttling isn't preventing updates (16ms = 60 FPS)
4. Verify Firestore shapes collection has data

### If flicker occurs:
1. Check grace period logic in `Rectangle.tsx` (1000ms timeout)
2. Verify `livePositionTimestampRef` is being set
3. Check console for timing logs: `[Rectangle] Live position cleared, starting grace period`
